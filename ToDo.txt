ToDo

Right away
    Original photo needs to be restored when back button pressed
        -When save button pressed, save changes made to photo
    Graphics for back and fwd buttons
    fix wait-fences
    Center image in algo view?
    

Main Objectives:
    Histogram overlay
    Educational, algorithm description overlay
    Finger slider adjustment to algorithms
    iPad implementation
    
Post 1st demo:
    subclass scrollview so OFmainviewcontroller isn't so cluttered. this class will talk to the OFphotoview and OFvideoview
    

Optimizations:
	* ImageConverter convertBitmapRGBA8ToUIImage:(unsigned char*)_photoView.originalImageViewPixelMap withWidth:width withHeight:height]; in OFMainViewController.m Shouldn't have to caste to (unsigned char*).  convertBitmapRGBA8ToUIImage should just take a pixel*
    
Known bugs:
    going from live video to pressing demo there is a malloc-free bug
    sometimes the animations don't complete
    Retina resizes some images and doesn't resize others.
